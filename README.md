# CakeOrderingApp

My first firebase project, staying focused on learning new things and using skills I have already learnt. So far app allows user to sign up(with google, facebook or email address ) order a bake good, pay for it (or not), follow his orders, check orders history, check shopping cart. I look at this project as a template in case I'd need to build a commerce app like shop, barber studio app where customers can book services or anything else.

## Technologies used: 
- Firebase
- Stripe
- Google authentication
- Facebook authetication
- Email Sign up and sign in


## Features implemented
- Authentication
- Online Database, FIREBASE
- Online payment, STRIPE
- Shopping cart
- Placed orders list
- Placed orders history
- Presentation of store
- Presentation of baked goods
- Store contact options

## TODO features
- Calendar (Let's say shop cannot handle to bake more than 3 birthday cakes a day due to space limit I want calendar when user can see if birthday cakes are available for this day)
- Better layout and GUI(I don't like how app looks but it's still in progress)
- Admin account (I want to make a special options for user who's signed as an admin, for a bakestore worker, like checking orders for this day,tomorrow, signing orders as completed etc. )

### Screenshots

## Main targets of this app : 
- Presentation of the store
- Contact 
- Option to order a bake good like bday cake, muffins
- Option to pay for order
- Firebase authentication with google, facebook, email
- Admin account which can mark order as Done 
- Calendar which show available days to order a birthday cake( let's say the store is a small startup with limited workers and space and they can't make 100 birthday cakes a day.)
