# CakeOrderingApp

My first firebase project, staying focused on learning new things and using skills I have already learnt. So far app allows user to sign up(with google, facebook or email address ) order a bake good, pay for it (or not), follow his orders, check orders history, check shopping cart. I look at this project as a template in case I'd need to build a commerce app like shop, barber studio app where customers can book services or anything else.

I think app would look better if the pics were a bit more professional(right now I'm using my own pictures, of my own stuff!
