# CakeOrderApp

My first firebase project, staying focused on learning new things and using skills I have already learnt.

## Main targets of this app : 
- Presentation of the store
- Contact 
- Option to order a bake good like bday cake, muffins
- Option to pay for order
- Firebase authentication with google, facebook, email
- Admin account which can mark order as Done 
- Calendar which show available days to order a birthday cake( let's say the store is a small startup with limited workers and space and they can't make 100 birthday cakes a day.)
